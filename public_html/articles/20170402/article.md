At first I wasn't sure if I should make a blog. The chance of anyone ever
reading it would be pretty low. The chance they keep reading beyond their first
article even lower. Would it really be worth it?

Then I started wondering why I should make a blog. Why did this thought ever
come into my head? It's not like I'm a writer or anything. Do I even like
writing? I think not.

Then I thought about why not. Writing the code would be fun.
Maybe. And then maybe I can get into writing things? Even if no one reads it
then at least I have some records of what I've been up to. Something to look
back on when I'm old. It's never too soon to prepare for being old I guess.

So here I am, starting a blog. From scratch. Why would I use some blogging
platform when I can do it myself. I don't need WordPress. Why even bother with
Jekyll. Not like my web host has it installed anyway. Yeah, let's go with that.

I've tried this before I think. Making a blog platform that is. I used Rails
last time, but the Ruby version on the server is outdated, so my code never
works. I'm not in the mood for downgrading the version on my computer for this.
As much as I loved PHP last time (not at all) I don't really want to get back
into that. I'm not in the mood for learning Perl right now either (sorry dad,
someday). So I guess I'm doing the back-end in Ruby (off Rails) and putting the
heavy lifting into the front end.

Typical me. Every project ends up coming back to JavaScript.

Now comes the fun part: choosing a framework. Or maybe it's not so fun. I'm not
a big fan of frameworks, but everyone's using them these days so I should
probably get around to learning them all. I'm going to choose React. Angular is
too big, and I'm not liking the syntax of Vue too much.

For posts I guess Markdown is easiest, with some extensions for various things.
There's no real back-end though, so I'll have to render it in the browser.
That's probably fine&hellip; how long an article can I write anyway. I'll
probably need some extra features, so I'll just parse add some Jekyll-like
front matter and variable interpolation. That should be enough. Remind me why
I didn't just use Jekyll?

Seems like a good enough plan then. Let's see how it goes.
