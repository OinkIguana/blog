This one goes way back, all the way to when I was just another kid in summer
camp learning how to make a website. I went to this camp many times, but the
best years were the ones when we had this one counsellor who was way cooler than
the rest. He seemed to have the answers to everything and could do things that
the others couldn't. I wanted to be like him -- writing code and doing cool
things. He might have been my inspiration to get to where I am now. When I think
about it I realize I might have already surpassed him, but little kid me doesn't
know that, and so I press on.

Anyway, the reason I bring him up is because one year he did a section on
"hacking" which, obviously, I decided to go to. He taught us about the history
of hacking, from Captain Crunch to a bunch of other things I have since
forgotten. Turns out it wasn't as exciting as I thought since he didn't teach us
how to hack anything. That may have been for the best.

What he did let us do, however, is play through a little web puzzle he came up
with. On a page he put an input box and maybe a few words. We were to hack into
this website by inputting the correct password in the box, so that the alert
would pop up "Access Granted!", and allow us to move on to the next stage. For
each level the password was just in the source code, manipulated a bit to give
us something to figure out, but to a group of children this felt like real
hacking.

There were only seven levels in total, each slightly increasing in difficulty,
but it took us three days to solve them all, even when working together. Arrays were
really complicated or something. I spent a lot of time on that w3schools page
about arrays, looking at the list of cars.

Once we were done, the other kids seemed to put it behind them, satisfied with
our victory. I, on the other hand, felt like there could've been more, and so
this puzzle has stuck with me since then. If I could go back and play the
original now I would, just to see how far I have come -- it would probably take
no more than 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I can't. I'm pretty sure it's been taken
down.

Fast forward a few years and I find myself working on a website of my own, a
place on the internet for just my friends. As I'm working on adding some games
and things for us to play at school when we should be doing our work, I remember
the puzzle from summer camp, and decide to make a version of it myself. I called
it the Hack Test, and only one other friend got into it.

// I tried to do it just now and gave up because of all the pointless
// calculations

Last month I go to check in on my old website to find that, after eight years,
he finally beat it. All 20 levels of my Hack Test. Eight years. I'm pretty sure
that it only really took that long because most of the levels were long and
convoluted and not really interesting puzzles. I don't blame him at all.

So I'm sitting there thinking "Man, that was a dumb test. I can do so much
better," when it strikes me that I can do *so much better*.

Which brings us to now. Over the past month I have been working on my second
attempt at making the Hack Test, this time with less of the pointless
calculations and more of the interesting puzzles. At the time of writing this
there are 21 levels. Some are more interesting than the others, but all of them
are better than my first Hack Test.

Maybe another day I'll go further into the development of the puzzles, but for
now I think I want to keep them all un-spoiled. I will, however, suggest that
you [try it out][] so that if I ever do get around to writing about it you'll be
ready. Good luck.
